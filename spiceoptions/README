spiceoptions vdsm hook:
===============================

This hook goes through VM definitions xml file and manipulate its
graphics device if the protocol type is spice. This can be used to
configure spice options on the fly. That said, this hook script
will be really useful to configure some of the spice optimization
attributes and values..

For ex:

  <graphics type='spice' port='-1' tlsPort='-1' autoport='yes'>
     ******
    <image compression='auto_glz'/>
    <streaming mode='filter'/>
    <clipboard copypaste='no'/>
    <mouse mode='client'/>
  </graphics>

Spice supports variable compression settings for audio, images
and streaming. These settings are accessible via the compression
attribute in all following elements: image to set image compression
(accepts auto_glz, auto_lz, quic, glz, lz, off),jpeg for JPEG
compression for images over wan (accepts auto, never, always),
zlib for configuring wan image compression (accepts auto, never, always)
..etc.

Streaming mode is set by the streaming element, settings its mode
attribute to one of filter, all or off.

Copy & Paste functionality (via Spice agent) is set by the clipboard
element.It is enabled by default, and can be disabled by setting
the copypaste property to no.

Mouse mode is set by the mouse element, setting its mode attribute
to one of server or client.If no mode is specified, the qemu default
will be used (client mode). 

Syntax:
   spiceoptions={'element': {'attribute': 'value'},..

For ex: 
   spiceoptions={'image': {'compression': 'auto_glz'},
		 'jpeg': {'compressions': 'never'}, 
		 'streaming':{'mode':'filter'}, 
		 'clipboard':{'copypaste':'yes'}}..etc


Installation:
* Use the engine-config to append the appropriate custom property as such:
	sudo engine-config -s UserDefinedVMProperties=
	'previousProperties;spiceoptions=^.*$' --cver=3.2

* Verify that the spiceoptions custom property was properly added:
	sudo engine-config -g UserDefinedVMProperties

Usage:
In the VM configuration window, open the custom properites tab
and add spiceoptions=

NOTE: Live migration is **not** tested.
